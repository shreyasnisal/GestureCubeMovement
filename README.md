# GestureCubeMovement

This repository contains the Arduino and Unity3D (C#) code for cube movement (push/pull) using hand gestures. Very similar to the [ARGestureCubeControl](https://github.com/shreyasnisal/ARCubeGestureControl) repository, but no use of Vuforia Engine and not augmented reality.

Check the AR repository for setup and running.
